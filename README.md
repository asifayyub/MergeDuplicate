Inorder to test this application, you must have to add current date folder format (yyyyMMdd) in both Admission and Scholarship folder under Input folder.

inside that date format folder in both Admission & Scholarship need to add files with admission-uniqueID*.txt and scholarship-uniqueID*.txt respectively.

Application will look only for current date folder in admission and if found then will look for current date folder in scholarship folder.

However application will first check for days it wont run on Saturday and sunday..
